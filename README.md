# Adveture Trivia
In Adventure Trivia, players can create and play games that test their knowledge.
The idea is as follows: Each game takes place across one or more geographical
locations where a player has to answer one or more questions as well as a riddle 
correctly in order to advance to the next location. The player will collect ruby
gems as he/she answers questions.
